# Kotlin Workshop #
## Activity 4 (The `when` Expression and Other Control Constructs) ##

#### Description ####
This activity involves using Kotlin's `when` and `with` expressions, or other expressions.

You must create three separate functions, two of which return strings depending on the parameters as expected in `Main.kt` and the other one takes advantage of `with` to modify a Data Class.

#### Notes ####
You need to know about the [`when` expression](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/control-flow.html) as well as the [`with` expression](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/with.html) and finally [data classes.](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html)
