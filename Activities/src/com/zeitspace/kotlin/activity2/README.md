# Kotlin Workshop #
## Activity 2 (Lambdas and Functions) ##

#### Description ####
For this activity you will be required to write multiple functions that either take advantage of lambdas or use fields as functions.

The input and output must be determined based on the `main` function in `activity2/Main.kt` as well as the comments within the `Activity2` object.

#### Notes ####
You'll need to know how to write [lambdas](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/lambdas.html) in Kotlin as well as what [inline](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/inline-functions.html) means and when to use it.

You'll have to uncomment the commented code in `Main.kt` to run your methods after you've define and implemented them.
